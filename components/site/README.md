## Site

Module for add, removing and listing sites.

Sites are symbolic links in the `~/.hypertext/workspace` directory to projects they allow a means to gather sites across disparate file system locations into a central directory.

Later we may add support for iterators like `foreach` but this command is primarily designed to be used by a GUI.
