# Hyper Text

Super fast, opinionated, site generator combining [pulldown-cmark][], [handlebars][] and [mdbook][].


```
ht
```

> Process all files in `site` and write the result to `build`.

Get short help with `ht -h` and see more detail with `ht --help`.

## TODO

* Support `ho(1)` for optimization pass to compress HTML etc.

## Notes

Much inspiration lifted from [mdbook][].
