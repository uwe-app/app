## Install

Binary executables are available to download for [linux](/files/ht-gnu-linux-x86_64); just rename the downloaded file to `ht` and put it in your `PATH` (digests are [here]({{digest_url}})).

Other platforms can be built from [source]({{repo_url}}) if you have the [rust][] toolchain installed. 

Once installed you can check out [usage](/usage/) to get started and learn more in the [docs](/docs/).
