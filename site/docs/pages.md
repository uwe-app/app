## Pages

Markdown and HTML documents are parsed as page templates. They are rendered using a [layout](/docs/layout/) unless configured to be [standalone](/docs/standalone/).

Like layouts they can include [partials](/docs/partials/) and may use all the handlebars features including [helpers](/docs/helpers/).
