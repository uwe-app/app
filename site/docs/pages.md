{{> components}}

Markdown and HTML documents are parsed as page templates. They are rendered using a [layout]({{ link "/docs/layout/" }}) unless configured to be [standalone]({{ link "/docs/standalone/" }}).

Like layouts they can include [partials]({{ link "/docs/partials/" }}) and may use all the handlebars features including [helpers]({{ link "/docs/helpers/" }}).
