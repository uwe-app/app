## Install

Binary executables are available to download for [Linux](/files/ht-gnu-linux-x86_64/ht); just put it in your `PATH`. Other platforms can be built from the [source](/source/) which is available upon request. 

Once you have hypertext [installed](/install/) you can get going with this one-liner:

```
ht init project && (cd project && ht --live)
```

Which will create a new website in the `project` folder; compile it then launch the site in a browser and watch the `project/site` directory for changes - you can get going right away!

Now you should edit the files in `project/site` and check your changes in the browser.
