## Quick Start

Once you have hypertext [installed](/install/) you can get going with this one-liner:

```
ht init project && (cd project && ht --live)
```

Which will create a new website in the `project` folder; compile it then launch the site in a browser and watch the `project/site` directory for changes - you can get going right away!

Now you should edit the files in `project/site` and check your changes in the browser.
