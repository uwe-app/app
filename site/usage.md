### Usage

Once you have hypertext [installed](/install/) you can get short help with `ht -h` and see more detail with `ht --help`:

```
{{include help.txt}}
```

Process all files in `site` and write the result to `build/release`.

```
ht --release
```

```
{{ include output.txt }}
```

For a debug version run `ht`; your website is now in `build/debug`.
