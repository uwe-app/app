<div>
  <strong>03. Open project (folder select error)</strong>
</div>

When the *Open Project* option is selected a native dialog asks the user to choose a folder. If a folder is selected and no error occurs then the interface proceeds to the *Project Editor* view.

Otherwise an error message indicates the problem:

<div class="wireframe flex padded sml rhythm">
  <span>Main tool bar w/ Logo</span>
</div>

<div class="wireframe flex column padded center error">
  <span>
    Folder /foo/bar/baz could not be opened.
    It is not a valid project; site settings are required in a site.toml file.
  </span>
</div>
