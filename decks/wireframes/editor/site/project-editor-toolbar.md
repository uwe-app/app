The *Project Editor* view shows a single project and controls to manage and edit files and preview the compiled website.

The toolbar at the top of the *Project Editor* shows the branding, provides a quick project switcher control and access to the *Open Project* and *Create Project* functions via a menu button. Later, the menu should include an option to edit the project settings - the *Settings Editor*.
